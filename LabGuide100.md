# Lab 100

## Introduction

 Machine learning-infused operational analytics is the key to success in next generation business processes.  The industries with abundant data are leading the way.  Executives need to learn about these breakthroughs in order to make to achieve operational excellence.  Oracle Autonomous Data Warehouse is the disruptive technology that is making this happen.  In this session, we will demonstrate three targeted solutions:  Intelligent Pricing & Customer Lifetime Value for Energy sector, Customer Segmentation & Churn Prediction for Telecoms and a novel Dynamic Pricing Model for Retail Stores.  This session will address business processes and the supporting technologies, so invite your data scientists, DBAs, and BI experts.
 
 This lab will show you how to setup the Autonomous Data Warehouse with ML users.

#### What is an Autonomous Data Warehouse?

Oracle Autonomous Data Warehouse provides an easy-to-use, fully autonomous data warehouse that scales elastically, delivers fast query performance and requires no database administration. It is designed to support all standard SQL and business intelligence (BI) tools, and provides all of the performance of the market-leading Oracle Database in an environment that is tuned and optimized for data warehouse workloads.

As a service Autonomous Data Warehouse does not require database administration. With Autonomous Data Warehouse you do not need to configure or manage any hardware, or install any software. Autonomous Data Warehouse handles creating the data warehouse, backing up the database, patching and upgrading the database, and growing or shrinking the database.

Additionally, Autonomous Data Warehouse does not require any tuning. Autonomous Data Warehouse is designed as a "load and go" service: you start the service, define tables, load data, and then run queries. When you use Autonomous Data Warehouse, no tuning is necessary. You do not need to consider any details about parallelism, partitioning, indexing, or compression. The service automatically configures the database for high-performance queries.

Autonomous Data Warehouse is built upon Oracle Database, so that the applications and tools that support Oracle Database also support Autonomous Data Warehouse. These tools and applications connect to Autonomous Data Warehouse using standard SQL*Net connections.

  * CPU Core Count - Number of CPUs for your service.(Minimum to be 5)
  * Storage (TB) - Select your storage capacity in terabytes. It is the actual space available to your service instance, including system-related space allocations.(Minimum to be 1 TB)
  
   ![](./images/adw5.PNG)
  
  * Administrator Credentials - Password for ADMIN user of the service instance. The password must meet the following requirements:
  * The password must be between 12 and 30 characters long and must include at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, and one numeric character.
      * The password cannot contain the username.
      * The password cannot contain the double quote (") character.
